Every data structure has a specific format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data, allowing data to be manipulated in various ways by users and computer systems.

        "  \n",
        "  Items of a set in python are immutable (unchangeable), do not duplicate values, and unordered. Thus, items in a set do not appear in a stipulated manner, i.e., they can appear in a different order every time it is used. Due to this, set items cannot be referred to by key or index\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  You can eliminate duplicates from a list, tuple, or string by converting it to a set and then back to the original type. For example, you can write: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6] numbers = list(set(numbers)) print(numbers) This will remove the duplicate 3 and 5 from the numbers list. You can also use the set() function to check if a list, tuple, or string has any duplicates by comparing its length with the length of the set. For example, you can write: name = \"Anna\" if len(name) == len(set(name)): print(\"No duplicates\") else: print(\"Has duplicates\") This will print \"Has duplicates\" because the name has two \"n\"s."
